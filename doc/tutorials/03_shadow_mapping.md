# Tutorial 03: Shadow Mapping

> **💡 Tip:** It's recommended using the [03_shadow_mapping.html](03_shadow_mapping.html) version of this tutorial as copying code works best there regarding padding and formatting.

> **Status:** This tutorial is currently under development.

This tutorial will cover implementing shadow mapping to add realistic shadows to your 3D scenes.

**Topics to be covered:**
- Shadow map rendering from light perspective
- Depth texture creation and sampling
- Shadow bias and peter-panning artifacts
- PCF (Percentage Closer Filtering) for soft shadows
- Integrating shadows into the lighting pipeline
